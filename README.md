# Automation Scripts Collection

This repository contains a growing collection of automation scripts created to streamline tasks, boost productivity, and solve everyday workflow problems. These tools include AHK scripts, PowerShell utilities, Python automation, batch tools, VBScript helpers, and Power Automate flows.

I built these scripts to speed up my own work and experiment with different automation techniques. Some are small one-off helpers, others are full workflows that save minutes or hours every week.

## Folder Structure
- **ahk**, automation created with AutoHotkey
